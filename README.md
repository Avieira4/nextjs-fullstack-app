Still WIP - This is my first attempt at a Next.js app. Also using Tailwind CSS, React and TypeScript. Following [this](https://youtu.be/lkjrUW8fI40) example project example.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
